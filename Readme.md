## Numi CLI

You can use Numi from command line on Linux and macOS. The CLI version is still experimental, and not all features are supported. 

### Installation

The recommended way is to install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): 

`brew install nikolaeu/numi/numi-cli`

You can also download the most recent CLI version manually from the [release preview](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi/releases/tag/preview) page.

### Usage

`numi-cli "20 inches in cm"`

### Alfred integration

New Alfred workflow for CLI can be downloaded from the [preview release](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi/releases/tag/preview) page. Note, there's no need to enable Alfred integration in app preferences with the new workflow.
